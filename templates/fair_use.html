        <h1>📚 Fair Use Policy</h1>
        
        <div class="fair-use-box">
            <strong>ℹ️ Educational Purpose:</strong> VidGrab is designed for educational, research, and personal use in accordance with fair use principles.
        </div>

        <h2>What is Fair Use?</h2>
        <p>Fair use is a legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances.</p>

        <h2>Four Factors of Fair Use</h2>
        
        <div class="factor">
            <strong>1. Purpose and Character of Use</strong>
            <p>Our service is intended for educational, research, and personal use. Non-commercial, transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="factor">
            <strong>2. Nature of the Copyrighted Work</strong>
            <p>Factual works are more likely to qualify for fair use than creative works. Published works are more likely to qualify than unpublished works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="factor">
            <strong>3. Amount and Substantiality</strong>
            <p>Using small portions of a work is more likely to be fair use than using the entire work. However, even small portions may infringe if they constitute the "heart" of the work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="factor">
            <strong>4. Effect on the Potential Market</strong>
            <p>Uses that don't harm the copyright owner's ability to profit from their work are more likely to be fair use.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Appropriate Uses</h2>
        <p>Examples of potentially fair uses include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Educational research and scholarship</li>
            <li>News reporting and commentary</li>
            <li>Personal archiving of legally obtained content</li>
            <li>Criticism and review</li>
            <li>Parody and transformation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
        <p>Users are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Determining whether their use qualifies as fair use</li>
            <li>Obtaining permission when fair use does not apply</li>
            <li>Ensuring compliance with local copyright laws</li>
            <li>Using downloaded content responsibly and legally</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
